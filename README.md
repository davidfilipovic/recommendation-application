## Recommendation application for PC video games, created in Clojure. 

  If you are bored with games you are currently playing and want to play something new and wild, this application is right choice for you. Built on using technique called collaborative filtering, it provides you a way to find new games based on your rating of games that you have already played, and accordingly rated.

  Advantage of technique used in this application is that the system does not rely on the values for the feature variables of its items (as in content-based filtering), and consequently such a system does not need to know about the characteristics of the items that are provided by it. There are a couple of algorithms in which collaborative filtering can be implemented, such as Slope One, Nearest Neighbor algorithm and Pearson correlation score, which are used in this application. 
  
  When the application is started, a user has to register or login. Initialy, one user, admin, with username **admin**, and password **admin** is inserted in database, so you can log in with these credentials.  After successful registration, Home page is shown, and because initialy there are no games in database, no game will be shown in minute or two, depending on users connection speed. After the page had been refreshed a couple of times, the list of games will be shown. After that, user can visit every game page, read about the game, and rate it.      

One note: *all* types of games that are implemented for playing on PC are included in the application, and they are exported from [Metacritic](http://www.metacritic.com) site.  

  If you anyhow receive a "Slow down, 429 Too Many Requests" error, just refresh the page again. This appears because Metacritic has some kind of restricting policy related to the crawling pages. Also, in order to play slideshow, you need the newest Adobe flash player installed.

## Instaling instructions

  Running this application is fairly simple. First you'll need to download it, in either way by cloning this repo to desktop or by downloading zip file. Read this instruction until the end, to find the most convinient way for you to run this application.

 First, you will need a database. For this application, I've used **mongoDB**, which is NoSQL database, and presents cross-platform document-oriented database.
  To start it, get mongo database from this [link](http://www.mongodb.org), install it, then navigate to *../bin/mongodb.exe* and wait until it has made connection to the localhost. 

  After that, you'll need to download and install [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org). **Leiningen** presents dependency management tool for configuration of projects written in the CLojure. It enables its user to create, bulid, test and deploy projects. If your machine is running on Microsoft Windows, than you can handy get [win instaler](http://leiningen-win-installer.djpowell.net), which will do all dirty work with PATH variable and similar stuff for you. After you have installed Leiningen open the command prompt, navigate to project folder and type **lein run**.
  
  The most easiest way to start application is to have Counterclockwise instaled as a Eclipse plugin, because in that case you already have Leiningen, and all you have to do to start application is to open project in Eclipse. To do that, first create new project (File->New->General->Project), choose  a project's name, uncheck *use default location*, and browse to the project folder. Once the application is opened in Eclipse's explorer, right click on the project, and choose Configure->Convert to Leiningen Project. Then, press **Alt L, L** (or right click on project, and then Leiningen->Generic Leiningen Command Line) and type **run**. You can find other informations related to installing and configuring Counterclockwise along with Leiningen [here](http://doc.ccw-ide.org/documentation.html).
  
## Libraries used 

### [Ring](https://github.com/ring-clojure/ring) and [Compojure](https://github.com/weavejester/compojure)

  These libraries provide the native Clojure API for working with servlets. Ring acts as a wrapper around Java servlet and allows web applications to be constructed of modular components that can be shared among a variety of applications, web servers, and web frameworks. On the other hand, Compojure uses Ring to map request-handler functions to specific URLs. It is important to notice that Ring has become the most used tool for building web applications, and therefore it has a large user community, which can be very helpful during creating applications.  

Dependecy for Ring: [ring "1.3.0"]
Dependecy for Compojure: [compojure "1.1.8"]

### [Hiccup](https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup) 

  I have used hiccup for defining a markup and generating HTML from it. It uses Clojure data structures in opposite to [Enlive](https://github.com/cgrand/enlive) for example, which uses pure HTML without any Clojure data structures. Hiccup uses vectors to represent elements, and for defining attributes it uses maps. It was very good experience to work with it, because it allows me to work completely in Clojure. 

Dependency: [hiccup "1.0.5"]

### [Hickory](https://github.com/davidsantiago/hickory)

  Opposite to Hiccup, Hickory parses HTML to Clojure data strucures, precisely into vectors (which are generated as hiccup vectors, along with their attributes). It is a very convinient way to grab any required content from a web site.
  
Dependency: [hickory "0.5.3"]

### Other

[Lib Noir](https://github.com/noir-clojure/lib-noir) presents set of utillities and helpers for handling common operations that can be found in web application. Dependency: [lib-noir "0.8.4"]

[Time](https://github.com/clj-time/clj-time) - used for formmating date and time. Dependency: [clj-time "0.8.0"]

## Literature

[Practical Clojure](http://www.amazon.com/Practical-Clojure-Experts-Voice-Source-ebook/dp/B003VM7G3S)

  This is the first book I have read about the Clojure. It is a good introductory book, and can give you good insight about functional programming, as well as basic Clojure functions and some features. Here you can learn how to set up Clojure environment for some basic real-world task. 

[Programming Clojure, Second Edition](http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Clojure-Stuart-Halloway/dp/1934356867)

  Second edition of this book presents some changes in Clojure, since it was first introduced in 2007. It has some good explanation about protocols, multimethods, and there is a whole chapter about Clojure's connections to Java.

[Clojure Programming](http://www.amazon.com/Clojure-Programming-Chas-Emerick/dp/1449394701/ref=pd_sim_b_1?ie=UTF8&refRID=0KCSHHVCSA3Z3YCX6JAF)

  Clojure programming is definetely the most comprehensive book about the topic. As Practical Clojure and Programming Clojure it contains explanations about functional languages in general, as well as explanations of Clojure functions and other features, but it goes much deeper into the core of the languge and explains all pros of working with CLojure. Although it is an excellent reference, I would strongly recommend to first read the two first books (and maybe [The Joy of Clojure](http://www.amazon.com/The-Joy-Clojure-Thinking-Way/dp/1935182641/ref=pd_sim_b_2?ie=UTF8&refRID=0KCSHHVCSA3Z3YCX6JAF)) before you start reading this book.   

[Web Development with Clojure](http://www.amazon.com/Web-Development-Clojure-Build-Bulletproof/dp/1937785645/ref=pd_sim_b_3?ie=UTF8&refRID=0KCSHHVCSA3Z3YCX6JAF)

  As its title says, this book is about developing a web applications using Clojure. It is written in a good, easy to understand manner, and for me it has excellent informations about vastly available libraries, tools and good practices out there, that can be used in bulding your application. This is definetely a must-read book about web development in CLojure, and I have used it a lot during bulding my application. Also, this book is published in 2014, so is definetely up to date, which is very important for a programming book. 

[Clojure for Machine Learning](http://www.amazon.com/Clojure-Machine-Learning-Akhil-Wali/dp/1783284358)

  The same as Web Development in Clojure, this book has also appeared in 2014, and it covers a plenty of techniques and algorithms for machine learning and their implementations in Clojure. Among other things, in this book techniques are described for building neural networks, understanding linear regression, categorizing and clustering data, working with matrices, etc. Of course, in seperate chapter there is explanation of recommendation system, which is divided into two sections, first about content-based filtering and second about collaborative filtering which is used in my application.
